# Estimation-of-CO-Emissions-in-Fault-Systems-at-a-Global-Scale
Machine learning was used to estimate CO₂ flux in tectonically active regions by integrating 867 degassing records with global raster variables. A stacking model (R²=0.677) outperformed individual regressors. Predictions were limited to an active-tectonic mask, revealing high-flux zones linked to geodynamic and geothermal processes.
